# Relative frequency and axioms of probability
As we will discuss more precisely in the following articles of this homework, probability is an abstract entity, whit certain properties, which is based on axioms. Let’s analize them:

## 1st Axiom (Non-negativity)

The probability of an event is a non-negative real number: P(E) ∈ R, P(E) >= 0 ∀ E∈F where F is the space of the events. It follows that P(E) is always finite, in contrast with more generale measure space theory

## 2nd Axiom (Unitarity)

This is the assumption of unit measure: that the probability that at least one of the elementary events in the entire sample space will occur is 1 . P(Ω) = 1
## 3rd Axiom (Additivity)

This is the assumption of sigma-additivity: any countable sequence of disjoint sets ( or mutually exclusive events ) E1,E2…. satisfies the fact that the probability of the union of the events is equal to the sum of their probabilities.
Since we analized relative frequencies in the previous articles, it is clear that there is a relationship between the above axioms and the formal properties of the relative frequency.

Since we have been working with populations and dataset, we can use the concept of “set” to talk about frequencies. Considering a population, which is a set of distinct entities, we can define subsets of them by grouping the ones with certain attributes: the relative frequency is then calculated dividing this subset by the total of the entities, which is the main set. Having said that, it is possible that there is no entity in our set which belongs a certain attribute, and in this case its frequency will be zero, but it is impossible for the frequency to be negative, as it is impossible for probability, thanks to the first axiom.

The same reasoning can be used to explain the relationship that occurs between the second axiom of probability, which states that the probability over the sample space is 1, and the fact that the relative frequency of all the events in the set is one. This means that the probability (frequency) that at least one of the elementary events in the entire sample space (dataset) will occur is 1.

Lastly, also additivity is both an axiom of the probability measure space and a formal property of the relative frequency. In fact, the frequency of the union of two or more subsets is the sum of those frequency, if they are distinguished. This means that the frequency of the union of all the events is equal to the sum of all the single frequencies, which is the same concept stated by the third axiom.
